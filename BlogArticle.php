          Support for climate adaptation in Africa is crucial, UN
          Secretary-General António Guterres said on Tuesday in appealing
          for greater action to provide renewable energy to hundreds of
          millions who still lack access to reliable and affordable
          electricity.
        </p>
        <p class="support-for-climate">
          “As the continent that has contributed least to the climate
          crisis, Africa deserves the strongest possible support and
          solidarity”, he told an online dialogue for leaders convened by
          the African Development Bank. Mr. Guterres warned that “adaptation
          must not be the neglected half of the climate equation”.

            This Objective Ahead Of COP26,” Mr. Guterres Said, Referring To
            The UN Climate Change Conference In November.“It Is Achievable.
            It Is Necessary. It Is Overdue. And It Is Smart: Climate Action
            Is A $3 Trillion Investment Opportunity In Africa By 2030,” He
            Added. However, the Secretary-General pointed to “the major
            finance” gap blocking progress towards this goal. He urged
            developed countries to deliver on their $100 billion climate
            commitment made over a decade ago.“Developed countries and main
            financers must ensure a swift shift of the billions to support
            African green investments, to increase resilience and to create
            the conditions for scaled-up private finance”, he said.“And the
            private sector must step up and get organized to provide
            immediate, concrete solutions to governments. Local authorities
            can work with unions and community leaders on reskilling and
            social security nets.”

            While African Governments also can lead the way by committing to ambitious adaptation and mitigation plans, they first need to regain
            their fiscal autonomy, he said. The Secretary-General stressed the need to extend the debt moratorium for developing countries, made last year
            in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and even cancelling debts where appropriate. Furthermore, Special Drawing Rights, a type of supplementary
            foreign reserve maintained by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), must also be made available to support Africa’s recovery.
